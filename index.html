        Úll is a conference for people who build and love great products. We focus on great product stories, presented through an Apple-shaped lens. We treat the conference itself as a product: with a deep emphasis on the attendee experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Úll 2016 will explore that very Apple-y of ideas: <em>thinking different</em>.</p>

      <p>We will hear stories from a selection of folks about what thinking different means to them, and we’ll learn more about ourselves and the world of building great products from a series of interactive features. As ever, we hope to come away having made some great new friends, and bringing a fresh outlook to our lives and to our work.

      Úll returns in 2016 to <a href="http://theeurope.com">The Europe</a>. This is a multi-award winning hotel and resort with stunning views overlooking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lough_Leane">Lough Leane</a>. Situated in Killarney, in the kingdom of Kerry, in Ireland’s south west coast (which you may be familiar with from a certain recent Star Wars film). It’s the perfect place to reflect on the bigger picture, steeped in natural beauty.
